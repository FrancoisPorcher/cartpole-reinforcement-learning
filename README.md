## Description

This project is an implementation of Deep Q Learning using OpenAI Gym's CartPole environment. The aim of the project is to experiment with Reinforcement Learning techniques and develop a model that can effectively balance the CartPole for as long as possible. The project provides a clear and concise example of how to use the Gym environment and Q-Learning algorithm to solve a simple yet interesting RL problem.



## Demonstration


This is what the trained policy looks like:

In comparison this is a random policy

## Usage


 - Clone the repository
 ```bash
 git clone 'git@github.com:FrancoisPorcher/cartpole-reinforcement-learning.git' 
 ```
 - Install dependencies
 ```bash
 run the google collab file
 ```


## Conclusion

I had a lot of fun doing this short project. This project is great starting point for anyone interested in learning about Reinforcement Learning, particularly using Deep Q Learning.
It demonstrates the use of OpenAI Gym and provides practical insights into how to train and evaluate RL models. The project can be easily extended to other environments and algorithms for more advanced RL tasks.
